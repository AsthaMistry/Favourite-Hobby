            <p>My favourite hobby is Drawing. It is so fun activity to spend time on. I like sketching. My teachers and parents do appreciate my paintings. The most thing like to draw, are animated cartoon characters. It is also important to use proper colours. You can use Crayons, pencil crayons, postel colours, acrylic paint, oil pastels and many more. The great artists paint on canvas but as a beginner I just use plain paper. One day I customized my own writing pad by painting on it, that turned out so good. I have so many hobbies but drawing is my most favourite hobby. Hope you liked it!!
